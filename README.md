## Preparing the RP2040

### Step 1: Flash CircuitPython onto the RP2040

1. **Download the CircuitPython firmware**:
   - Visit [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/) and download the `.uf2` file for the RP2040 (make sure to match your board's model).

2. **Enter Bootloader Mode**:
   - Connect the RP2040 to your computer via USB while holding down the **BOOTSEL** button.
   - A new drive named `RPI-RP2` should appear on your computer.

3. **Flash CircuitPython**:
   - Copy the downloaded `.uf2` file onto the `RPI-RP2` drive.
   - The RP2040 will restart, and a new drive named `CIRCUITPY` should appear. This confirms CircuitPython is now running on the board.

### Step 2: Prepare the RP2040 for the Code

1. **Download and Install Thonny**:
   - Download [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/).
   - Install Thonny and launch the application.

2. **Set up Thonny for CircuitPython**:
   - Go to **Tools > Options > Interpreter**.
   - Set the Interpreter to **CircuitPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)**.
   - Select the correct COM port for your RP2040 if not detected automatically.

3. **Setup Required Libraries**:
   - Copy the files from the `lib` folder of this project to the `lib` folder on your `CIRCUITPY` drive
   - Your `CIRCUITPY` drive should now have a `lib` folder with these libraries.

4. **Copy the Code**:
   - Save the GymBuddy code as `code.py` and place it in the root directory of your `CIRCUITPY` drive.

5. **Restart the RP2040**:
   - Eject the `CIRCUITPY` drive safely from your computer.
   - Unplug and replug the RP2040, or press the reset button.
   - The code will automatically run, and you should see the timer on the OLED display.
